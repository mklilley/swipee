## Why Swipee?

**Reading lists suck!** If you're anything like me, then you're interested in everything but see opportunity cost around every corner. Save everything for later and then get paralysed by choice. Hunker down for a long read, watch a quick video or catch up with one of the dozens of podcasts you subscribe to ? ðŸ˜£

Swipee makes the choice for you. Instead of a reading list, Swipee uses a deck of swipeable cards - left to discard, right to save for later. This way, you'll never have to see your ever growing list of content ðŸ™Œ . Swipee also helps you to be more honest about the content you want to save for later. By using financial incentives, Swipee encourages you to think twice before you swipe right.

## The history of Swipee

I built a basic version of Swipee in the Spring of 2018 and have been using it every day since. I thought other people might also find it useful, so in Spring 2021 I decided to clean it up and make it available to everyone for free.

## How I made Swipee

Here is a rough guide to how I got here.

### Front end

The Swipee front end is built using [Vue.js version 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html). I used the [Vue CLI version 4.5.11](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to create the project and then added [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) capability

- `npm install -g @vue/cli`
- `vue create swipee`
- `vue add pwa`

I consulted the [Vue PWA documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/core-plugins/pwa.html#configuration) to help me with the config and used the [Vue PWA asset generator](https://github.com/jcalixte/vue-pwa-asset-generator) to generate all the necessary icons.

In order for Swipee to update on iOS when it's installed on the home screen, I needed to add:

```
workboxOptions: {
  skipWaiting: true
}
```

to the pwa setting in `vue.config.js`

Swipee uses a swipeable cards UI that heavily draws upon the work of [Mateusz Rybczonek](https://madewithvuejs.com/swipeable-cards). Mateusz's project uses Sass for the css and uses [interact.js](https://interactjs.io/) to make the cards dragable. I therefore needed to install the `sass-loader` (described in the [Vue css docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/css.html#postcss)) and install the `interactjs` library. Specifically:

- `npm install -D sass-loader sass`
- `npm install --save interactjs`

To filter the cards, I needed to adapt [v-chips-multiselect](https://github.com/zisuzon/v-chips-multiselect) - originally designed for vue2. This involved using [vue3-click-away](https://github.com/VinceG/vue-click-away) among other changes - see `src/components/ChipsMultiselect.vue` for more details.

I use Google's [recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) with [vue-recaptcha](https://github.com/DanSnow/vue-recaptcha) to protect my feedback form from spam - noting to use the `vue-v3` branch via:

- `npm install "https://github.com/DanSnow/vue-recaptcha.git#vue-v3" --save`

In order to take payments for Swipee credits, I used [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) and in particular I used their [integration builder](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/integration-builder) selecting the `Custom payment flow` to avoid redirects and page reloads that come with usual payment flow. I combined and adapted the `checkout.html` `client.js` and `global.css` into a single component `src/components/Payment.vue`. To make stripe work inside of a vue component I needed to include the [stripe-js](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js) module:

- `npm install @stripe/stripe-js --save`

To speed up the download time of the app, I followed this [performance optimisation article](https://medium.com/@aetherus.zhou/vue-cli-3-performance-optimization-55316dcd491c) and opted for "lazy loading" of routes and also compression of the build files. Because Vue3 uses webpack version 4, I needed to use a less up to date version of the `compression-webpack-plugin` to avoid build errors. Specifically:

- `npm install --save-dev compression-webpack-plugin@6.1.1`

### Back end

To make the swipable cards look nice, we use [link-preview-lite](https://github.com/mklilley/link-preview-lite) - a simple NodeJS server that generates a link preview based on information in the head of the link html.

Although uses can store their swipable card data on their devices [localStorage](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-complete-guide-to-using-localstorage-in-javascript-apps-ba44edb53a36/), I created an online storage option in case the localStorage gets wiped (this can sometimes happen on mobile devices). This remote storage also allows users to sync data across devices.

I am using an an open-source json storage system ([jsonbox](https://jsonbox.io/)) for the online storage. I [slightly adapted it](https://github.com/mklilley/jsonbox/) and deployed it on my server using the [instructions](https://github.com/mklilley/jsonbox#how-to-run-locally) that jsonbox provides.

To check users' Swipee credits and to initiate and confirm stripe payments, I created a node server. Check out the [api](tree/main/api) folder for more details about how I set that up.

I use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to process the feedback form and route responses to my personal email address.

## Disclaimer

I code for fun in my spare time so this is not a professional app/service. Please don't use this app to store sensitive information - it's not been stress tested for data security bugs. Data lives on your device and you can export it to a text file at any time. There is also an online storage option. There is no backup of the online storage - so if your data is lost due to some technical issues then it is lost forever. I'll do my best to keep the app/service running indefinitely, but if it starts getting abused then I might have to shut it down.
